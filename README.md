# Study Algorithms

As I review concepts from my Algorithms and Data class and explore new ones, I will be adding my notes, cheetsheets, practice problems, and videos I find helpful to this repo. I hope the material here helps you on your learning journey...

### Concepts Overview
* [Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures](#introduction)
* [Algorithm Analysis and Complexity](#analysis_and_complexity)
* Arrays and Dynamic Arrays
* Linked Lists
* Stacks and Queues
* Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees)
* Heaps and Priority Queues
* Hash Tables and Hashing
* Graphs (Representation, Traversals, Shortest Paths)
* Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
* Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)
* Dynamic Programming
* Divide and Conquer Algorithms
* Greedy Algorithms
* Backtracking Algorithms
* String Algorithms
* Advanced Data Structures (Tries, B-trees, Red-Black Trees)
* Advanced Graph Algorithms (Minimum Spanning Trees, Topological Sorting)
* Advanced Sorting Algorithms (Radix Sort, Counting Sort)
* NP-Completeness and Introduction to Computational Complexity
